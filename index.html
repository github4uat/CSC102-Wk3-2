Title: Galactic Pods
Scene: The year is 2025 and things are going well in the outer edge of earth's orbit.  The quest for ubiquitous 
high speed internet across the globe has led to rapid expansion of semi-inhabitable spaces known as Galactic Pods.  
These Pods are used as Travel Destinations for Earth's ultra wealthy, as well as refractory satellites for Ubiquinet,
(the high speed internet that made the majority of other forms of internet obsolete).  

A typical Galactic Pod is about the size of a football field, and is comprised of dozens of nodules that have been
sent to space individually and connected together, similar to the space station.  These nodules can be easily added 
and removed from a Galactic Pod, and sent further into space, or back to earth for repair.  There are many different
types of nodules, including farm, garden, restaurant, casino, entertainment, relaxation, excercise, business, etc.  
Basically any type of space we could think of on Earth has been shrunk into a capsule and launched into space.

The casinos in Galactic Pods are quite exquisite.  Comprised of enormous windows framing stunning views of Earth 
and the moon, these casinos are like no other.  Exterior's are cladwith a light colored, highly 
reflective material commonly referred to as "moon dust'.  Resembling an opaque version of marble, and backlit 
with warm light, there is quite literally no known comparable experience.  

Unlike earth, where we're bound by gravity and the roofs that contain us, Galactic Pods expand indefinitely. As part of a large expanse of nodes, similar
to a 3-d model of a DNA strand, you get the sense that you're part of a larger, dynamically changing matrix of construction
and expansion.  As jet packs take individuals between various Pods at scheduled intervals throughout the day, there's a
feeling of both being overwhelmed and miniaturized at the same time.
